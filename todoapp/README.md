Software
Django == 2.0
Python == 3.6

In order to run the application you must CD into the todoapp and run: python manage.py runserver.

Ideally should have set up a base.html file as the application needs multiple webpages.

Additionally, adding a catgeory works however if the user clicks on the ADD CAT button on the index page it does not take them through to that page,
still sorting out this particular problem.
